    <p class="montserrat-400">
      In the AB testing project, we're working to understand the underlying
      statistics for A/B tests on websites. In this assignment, we're creating a
      small change to a static HTML website, and testing the small changes in
      user interactions. A/B Testing helps us drive quantitative analysis on
      user interactions and helps us understand the impact of changes on user
      behavior due to design changes. In our website, we're measuring the change
      in users doing a specific task of scheduling the following: "Schedule an
      appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23,
      2024"
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to design</h3>
    <p class="montserrat-400">
      In this project, I changed the 'schedule appointment' buttons to light
      blue to make them easier to see and make the interaction more clear. I
      also changed the title of the table to "Schedule an Appotinment Below" so
      users are more clear on what they have to do. I've attached a photo below.

    <h3>My Metric</h3>
    <p>
      The metric that I chose is the mouse movement distance, which is measured
      in pixels. I selected this metric because a well-designed website should
      have less mouse movement to get to the desired behavior. I wanted to test
      this idea and see if it’s true.

      <h3>My Hypothesis</h3>

      <h4>Misclick Rate</h4>

      Null Hypothesis: The misclick rate in version A will be the same as the
      misclick rate in version B Alternative Hypothesis: The misclick rate in
      version B will be different than the misclick rate in Version A My
      hypothesis: Since the color of ‘schedule appointment’ is now highlighted,
      I think it will be easier for users to find the correct button to press to
      schedule the appointment. Therefore, the misclick rate will differ. That’s
      why I chose this as the alternative hypothesis. I hypothesize that that
      null hypothesis will be rejected.

      <h4>Time on Page</h4>

      Null Hypothesis: The time on page (in milliseconds) in version A will be
      the same as the misclick rate in Version B Alternative Hypothesis: The
      time on page (in milliseconds) in version B will be less than the time on
      page in Version A My hypothesis: Since the title has changed to be more
      clear, a user will understand that the primary screen they’re on is to
      schedule an appointment. Therefore, it should be quicker to schedule an
      appointment. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis states that version B
      will have a lower time on page metric. I hypothesize that the null
      hypothesis will be rejected and the alternative will be accepted.

      <h4>Mouse Move Distance</h4>

      Null Hypothesis: The mouse movement distance (measured in pixels) in
      version A will be the same as the mouse movement distance in version B
      Alternative Hypothesis: The mouse movement distance (measured in pixels)
      in version B will be different than as the mouse movement distance in
      version A My hypothesis: Mouse movement distance may decrease due to good
      design. Therefore, the alternate hypothesis states that the mouse movement
      in Version B will be less than in Version A. However, a user may move
      their mouse around the screen when they are reading the text. Therefore,
      this may be the same across both designs. I hypothesize that we fail to
      reject the null hypothesis.

      <h3>Solutions</h3>
      <h4>Misclick Rate</h4>
      <p>
        For misclick rate we used the chi^2 test since this was a categorical
        assessment. The chi^2 value was 6.428571429. This is a high chi^2 value
        and indicates that there is a significant deviation in misclicks than if
        we were to expect the misclicks to be the same in both versions. On the
        other hand, the p-value is 0.01, suggesting that there is a
        statistically significant difference between the two frequencies.
        Therefore, from this information, we can reject the null hypothesis and
        accept the alternative hypothesis that the two misclick rates are
        different.
      </p>
      <h4>Time on Page</h4>
      <p>
        For time on page we used the one tailed t-test. We used this t-test
        because the alternative hypothesis was to prove that time on page in B
        was less than in A. In this case, the mean of A is 38,216.95 while the
        mean of B is 9,046.29. Th​​e p-value is .999999998 for A < B. Since the
        p-value is so close to the hypothesis of A < B, then we can confidently
        reject this. Therefore, we can confidently state that B < A. Thus, we
        can reject the null hypothesis that these are the same, and accept the
        alternative hypothesis which states that B will be less than version A.
      </p>
      <h4>Mouse Move Distance</h4>
      <p>
        For mouse movement, I used the two-tailed t-test. We used this t-test
        because the alternative hypothesis was to prove that there is a
        difference between the time on page, rather than a certain direction.
        There is a difference between version A & version B which is
        statistically significant with a p-value of 0.0001. A high t-score
        indicates that there is a significant difference between the means, and
        a negative t-score (depending on the calculation), means that the mean
        of A is higher than the mean of B. Comparing the means, A has a mean of
        8975.16572 while B has a mean of 2796.220981. A has a significantly
        higher mean and is statistically significant. Therefore, we can
        confidently reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative
        hypothesis that these values are different.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the changes that I made to the website were successful in
        improving the user experience. The misclick rate was significantly
        different between the two versions, with the new version having a lower
        misclick rate. The time on page was also significantly different between
        the two versions, with the new version having a lower time on page. The
        mouse movement distance was also significantly different between the two
        versions, with the new version having a lower mouse movement distance.
        Overall, I made effective changes and learned about the powerful nature
        of statistical tests to measure the impact of design changes on user
