    <p class="montserrat-400">
      In the AB testing project, we're working to understand the underlying
      statistics for A/B tests on websites. In this assignment, we're creating a
      small change to a static HTML website, and testing the small changes in
      user interactions. A/B Testing helps us drive quantitative analysis on
      user interactions and helps us understand the impact of changes on user
      behavior due to design changes. In our website, we're measuring the change
      in users doing a specific task of scheduling the following: "Schedule an
      appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23,
      2024"
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to design</h3>
    <p class="montserrat-400">
      In this project, I changed the 'schedule appointment' buttons to light
      blue to make them easier to see and make the interaction more clear. I
      also changed the title of the table to "Schedule an Appotinment Below" so
      users are more clear on what they have to do.
